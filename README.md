Amazon Landing Page Clone

This project is a detailed replica of the Amazon landing page, created using HTML and CSS. It serves as my first foray into web development, focusing on mastering foundational skills in front-end design and layout. The page incorporates key elements commonly found on the Amazon website, including a responsive navigation bar, product categories, promotional banners, and a footer with essential links.

The design emphasizes attention to detail, ensuring proper alignment, spacing, and visual consistency. CSS is utilized extensively for styling, enabling the creation of a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. Media queries have been integrated to ensure the page is responsive across devices, offering a seamless experience for users on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

This project represents the beginning of my journey in software engineering and web development. It reflects my ability to translate real-world designs into code, using semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques. While the current iteration is static, I plan to enhance it by incorporating JavaScript for interactivity, such as dynamic carousels, dropdown menus, and user-driven features. I also aim to integrate backend technologies in the future to make the page fully functional, such as enabling user authentication, search functionality, and cart management.

This project highlights my commitment to continuous learning and improvement, as I explore new technologies to elevate its functionality and broaden my skill set.
